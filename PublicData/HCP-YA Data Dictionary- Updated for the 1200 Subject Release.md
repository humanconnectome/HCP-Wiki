### Instrument: Episodic Memory (Picture Sequence Memory)

**Instrument Description:**


> The Picture Sequence Memory Test is a measure developed for the Open of episodic memory for ages 3-85 years. It involves recalling increasingly lengthy series of illustrated objects and activities that are presented in a particular order on the computer screen. The participants are asked to recall the sequence of pictures that is demonstrated over two learning trials; sequence length varies from 6-18 pictures, depending on age. Participants are given credit for each adjacent pair of pictures (i.e., if pictures in locations 7 and 8 and placed in that order and adjacent to each other anywhere - such as slots 1 and 2 - one point is awarded) they correctly place, up to the maximum value for the sequence, which is one less than the sequence length (if there are 18 pictures in the sequence, the maximum score is 17, because that is the number of adjacent pairs of pictures that exist). The test takes approximately 7 minutes to administer. This test is recommended for ages 3-85.

### Instrument: Executive Function/Cognitive Flexibility (Dimensional Change Card Sort)

**Instrument Description:**


> DCCS is a measure of cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). "Switch" trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. For example, after 4 straight trials matching on shape, the participant may be asked to match on color on the next trial and then go back to shape, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time, and the test takes approximately 4 minutes to administer. This test is recommended for ages 3-85.

### Instrument: Fluid Intelligence (Penn Progressive Matrices)

**Instrument Description:**


> Fluid intelligence is measured using Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Prabhakaran et al. 1997; Christoff et al. 2001; Gray et al. 2003; Conway et al. 2005; Gray et al. 2005; Wendelken et al. 2008). We use Form A of an abbreviated version of the Raven’s developed by Gur and colleagues (Bilker et al. 2012). Participants are presented with patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 or 1x5 arrangements of squares, with one of the squares missing. The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing square on the pattern. The task has 24 items and 3 bonus items, arranged in order of increasing difficulty. However, the task discontinues if the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row.

### Instrument: Self-regulation/Impulsivity (Delay Discounting)

**Instrument Description:** 


> Delay discounting describes the undervaluing of rewards that are delayed in time. It is illustrated by the fact that humans (and other animals) will often choose a smaller immediate reward over an objectively larger, but delayed reward. We use a version of the discounting task that identifies ‘indifference points’ at which a person is equally likely to choose a smaller reward (e.g., $100) sooner versus a larger reward later (e.g., $200 in 3 years). Based on the work of Green and Myerson (Estle et al. 2006; Green et al. 2007), we use an adjusting-amount approach, in which delays are fixed and reward amounts are adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis based on participants’ choices, to rapidly hone in on indifference points. This approach has been repeatedly validated to provide reliable estimates of delay discounting (Estle et al. 2006). As a summary measure, we use an area-under-the-curve discounting measure (AUC) that provides a valid and reliable index of how steeply an individual discounts delayed rewards (Myerson et al. 2001).

### Instrument: Spatial Orientation (Variable Short Penn Line Orientation Test)

**Instrument Description:**


> Spatial orientation processing is measured using the Variable Short Penn Line Orientation Test (Gur et al. 2001a; Gur et al. 2010). Participants are shown two lines with different orientations. They have to rotate one of the lines (a moveable blue one) so that is parallel to the other line (a fixed red line). The rotation of the blue line is accomplished by clicking buttons on the keyboard that rotate the lines either clockwise or counterclockwise. Across trials, the lines vary in their relative location on the screen, though the distance between the centers of the two lines is always the same. The length of the red line is always the same, but the length of the blue line can be either short or long. There are a total of 24 trials

### Instrument: Verbal Episodic Memory (Penn Word Memory Test)

**Instrument Description:**


> Verbal episodic memory is measured using Form A of the Penn Word Memory Test (Gur et al. 2001a; Gur et al. 2010). Participants are shown 20 words and asked to remember them for a subsequent memory test. They are then shown 40 words (the 20 previously presented words and 20 new words matched on memory related characteristics). They decide whether they have seen the word previously by choosing among “definitely yes,” “probably yes,” “probably no,” and “definitely no.”

### Instrument: Working Memory (List Sorting)

**Instrument Description:**


> This task assesses working memory and requires the participant to sequence different visually- and orally-presented stimuli. Pictures of different foods and animals are displayed with both a sound clip and written text that name the item. The task has two different conditions: 1-List and 2-List. In the 1-List condition, participants are required to order a series of objects (either food or animals) in size order from smallest to largest. In the 2-List condition, participants are presented both food and animals and are asked to report the food in size order, followed by the animals in size order. Children ages 3-6 have four practice items in each condition: two practice items in which the images appear simultaneously on the screen and two practice items in which the images briefly "flash" sequentially on the screen. Participants ages 7-85 have two practice items, both "flashing" in each condition. Different instructions are provided for 3-6 and 7-85 year olds in English and for 3-6, 7-17 and 18-85 year olds in Spanish.

### Instrument: Five Factor Model (NEO-FFI)


> There is consensus that a five factor model captures the major facets of human personality across cultures (Heine and Buchtel 2009): a) neuroticism; b) extroversion/introversion; c) agreeableness; d) openness; and e) conscientiousness (Goldberg 1993; McCrae and Costa 2008). We are administering the 60 item version of the Costa and McRae Neuroticism/Extroversion/Openness Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), which has shown excellent reliability and validity (McCrae and Costa 2004). This measure was available as part of the Penn Computerized Cognitive Battery (Gur et al. 2001a; Gur et al. 2010).

### Restricted Instrument: Life Function (Achenbach Adult Self-Report, Syndrome Scales and DSM-Oriented Scale)


> The NIH toolbox contains self-report measures of a number of important domains of experience, including positive and negative affect, stress, anxiety, depression and social support. To obtain additional self-report information on an even broader variety of domains, we also administer the Achenbach Adult Self-Report for Ages 18-59 (Achenbach 2009). Specifically, we administer the 123 items from Section VIII. These can be used to generate the ASR Syndrome Scales and the ASR DSM-Oriented Scales.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NIH Toolbox Words-In-Noise Age 6+: Computed Score | Noise\_Comp | Open | ^[-+]?[0-9]\*[.]?[0-9]+$ | =,NOT =,<, | This automated audiometric test measures hearing thresholds at six different frequencies (.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kHz), separately in the left and right ears. On each trial, the participant’s task is to detect whether a pure tone was presented via headphones by answering yes (tone heard) or no (tone not heard). This test takes approximately nine minutes to administer and is recommended for ages 6-85. Based on the participant’s responses, the computer software automatically scores each trial at each of the frequencies for left and right ears, determining the hearing threshold (in decibels)—that is, the level below which the participant cannot hear the tone.To provide a unifying score for Toolbox users, a single hearing metric is provided that is commonly used: a Pure Tone Average (PTA). This is calculated by averaging the threshold scores of 1, 2 and 4 kHz frequencies. Scores for each ear are calculated, with the PTA from the better ear reported as the primary score (i.e., the ear with the lower PTA). |

| NIH Toolbox Pain Intensity Survey Age 18+: Raw ScoreExcluded currently due to glich in the Toolbox data download | PainIntens\_RawScore |  |  |  | This measure consists of a single item measuring immediate (i.e., acute) pain in adults. It asks a participant to rate level of pain experienced “over the last seven days.” It takes less than one minute to administer and is recommended for ages 18-85.Scoring Process: The single item is simply scored on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing no pain, and 10 representing the “worst imaginable pain.” No derived scores are available. |
| NIH Toolbox Pain Interference Survey Age 18+: T-score | PainInterf\_Tscore | Open | ^[-+]?[0-9]\*[.]?[0-9]+$ | =,NOT =,<,> | This brief self-report scale measures the degree to which pain interferes with other activities in life in adults. Pain interference items were developed as part of the NIH PROMIS. This measure is administered as a CAT and takes approximately three minutes. It is recommended for ages 18-85. Each item administered has a 5-point scale with options ranging from “not at all” to “very much” on questions about how much pain interferes with aspects of one’s life. The survey is scored, and while no Toolbox norms are available for this measure, the scores are converted to general T-scores based on the PROMIS sample to whom this test was given. |
