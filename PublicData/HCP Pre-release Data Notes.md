The WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (HCP) releases imaging data from subjects on a regular basis. Details on what data is included in each release are available in the Reference Manual for that release on the [HCP documentation page](https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/humanconnectome.org/documentation/).Â  On this wiki page, we document known special cases in the data collected between releases. This data has not yet been released, so this page acts a placeholder for issues/features of certain subject data that will persist even after processing and release. When a release containing a subject noted here occurs, all the information documented here for that subject will be moved to the appropriate section of the  page. 

# Post 500 Subjects Release (post June 6, 2014)

## **Notes**

***Defacing versions - Subjects with v2 defacing algorithm applied***   
Defacing is performed on all HCP scans to ensure anonymity of subjects. When structural QC is performed, correct defacing is checked. In a limited number of cases, the original version 1 of the defacing algorithm ([Milchenko and Marcus, 2013](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12021-012-9160-3)) did not deface the images sufficiently so an updated version 2 defacing was performed. Here are the subjects to which v2 defacing was applied:

Contact Dan Marcus at [dmarcus@WUSTL.EDU](mailto:dmarcus@WUSTL.EDU) for questions on details and differences between the two defacing algorithm versions.
