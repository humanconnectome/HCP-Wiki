Anyone interested may join the public **HCP-Users (discussion forum for all things HCP)** or **HCP-Announce (no-reply announcement list)** Google groups hosted at:

**HCP-Users:** <https://groups.google.com/a/humanconnectome.org/d/forum/hcp-users>

**HCP-Announce:** <https://groups.google.com/a/humanconnectome.org/d/forum/hcp-announce>

You may have been signed up for one or both of these Google groups by filling out the form on <https://www.humanconnectome.org/contact-us> long ago or more recently. If you did, we migrated your account from Mailman (our old listserve) and you will still receive messages from both lists and can still post to HCP-Users, depending on which list(s) you are subscribed to.

However, if you did not subscribe to the list(s) with a Gmail account, you will need to set up a Google account for the email you subscribed to the list with (often your institutional email rather than a Gmail account) for you to be able to see HCP-Users or HCP-Announce listed as "My Groups" in the Google Groups UI or change your list settings (e.g. digest vs. messages as they are sent).

Below are steps to create a Google account with a non-Gmail email address to enable these account settings. In addition, you can find the steps for managing subscriptions. 

If you have questions, please feel free to email Jenn Elam at elam@wustl.edu
