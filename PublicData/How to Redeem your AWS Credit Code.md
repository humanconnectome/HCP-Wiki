In order to help cover the initial costs of using Amazon Web Services (AWS) (and, or course, to encourage you to use AWS), Amazon has provided each participant in the Exploring the Human Connectome 2017 course with an AWS Credit Code (a character and numeral string that we will provide to each course participant upon request). These instructions will guide you through the process of redeeming that credit code, thus applying the associated credit amount to your account. You must have an AWS account prior to redeeming your credit code. If you do not have an AWS account and wish to create one, see .

Once you have an AWS account, redeem your credit code by following these steps:

1. Visit <https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits>. This should take you to the *Redeem Your AWS Promotional Credit* page (see Figure 1).

2. Since you already have an AWS account, select the *Redeem Credit* button. If you are already logged in to your AWS account, you will be taken to the *Credits* page (see Figure 2). If you are not currently logged in, you will be asked to sign in to your AWS account and then be taken to the *Credits* page (see Figure 2) after you have successfully signed in.

3. On the *Credits* page, enter the AWS Credit Code you were given into the *Promo Code* box, type the characters shown in the *Security Check* image into the *Security Check* text box, and select the *Redeem* button.

---
4. You should receive verification that your credit is redeemed and available in the form of a table listing your credit's: Expiration Date, Credit Name, Credits Used, and Credits Remaining.

---
5. That is all you need to do to have the credit available. You should be aware though that the credits will automatically be applied to your bill for AWS services. As you experiment with or use AWS services that are not in the *Free Tier*, the credits will be used to cover any costs you incur. As soon as the credit value is used up, any costs you incur ***will be billed to your credit card***.  


---
6. Sign out of your AWS account and Amazon account by selecting the down arrow next to your name in the upper right hand corner and selecting *Sign Out.*

## Information from the *AWS Cloud Credits for Research* program

**AWS Credit Codes provided for the *Exploring the Human Connectome 2017* course** **will expire on April 30, 2018 or when promotional credit is fully depleted, whatever comes first**- **please note that the duration cannot be extended.**

Please keep in mind this balance updates monthly after billing computation occurs for the prior month. **Upon depleting your** **promotional** **credits, your billing will automatically switch to the credit card on file and the account will be charged immediately. We strongly encourage you to set up [Billing Alerts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/monitor-charges.html) as we typically cannot provide refunds for overage charges. See the PDF document *AWS\_Cloud\_Credits\_for\_Research\_Additional\_Info.pdf* (available below) for further details.**

**In addition, the *AWS\_Cloud\_Credits\_for\_Research\_Additional\_Info.pdf* document includes links to key resources to help you get started on AWS.**

## **Important Information on Services Covered and Consolidated Billing/AWS Global Channel Reseller Program:**

**The full list of AWS services covered by these promotional credits** is available under ‘credits’ tab in your AWS account dashboard. Promotional credits may not be used for Reserved Instance fees or Mechanical Turk and subscription charges.

**If you are planning to sign up for consolidated billing and join a payer account please wait till your promotional credits are utilized.**

**If your account is managed by one of the direct AWS resellers through our AWS Global Channel Reseller Program, your promotional credits will roll to the payer account just like in a consolidated billing situation.** 

Please acknowledge AWS support in your papers, course website, and/or conference proceedings; you may simply state that your work was **supported by the AWS Cloud Credits for Research program**.

Sincerely,

The AWS Research Credits Team
