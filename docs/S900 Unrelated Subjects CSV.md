This csv spreadsheet has 339 unrelated subjects from the S900 release with a T1, a T2, complete rfMRI, and physiological data.   
  
 If you end up using the fMRI data for these subjects, please note that two different image reconstruction algorithms were used on this data (r177 early in the project, r227 later) and data from the different reconstructions shouldn't be mixed in an analysis. The structural data should be unaffected by this and all the diffusion data were reconstructed using the r227 algorithm.
