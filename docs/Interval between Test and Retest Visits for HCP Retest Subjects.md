A subset of HCP twin pair Subjects were recruited for a full retest of the HCP 3T scan protocol and behavioral battery in a second retest visit. We made an effort to schedule the retest visit as soon as possible after the initial study visit, as the scanner schedule (booked scheduled approximately 6 months out for the life of the study) and travel arrangements allowed. As possible, we also tried to schedule retest visits for the twin pair to come back together.
